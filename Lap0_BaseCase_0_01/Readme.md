## Model Setup and Metadata

This lap includes a MESH model setup for Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-Sample SPATially distributed analysis (CAMELS-SPAT) Basin

This is out of the box run with the default parameters for CLASS.ini and Hydrology.ini based on previous study.

## Data Description

### Forcing Data

The model uses 7 key climate forcing variables from the **Canadian Surface Reanalysis (CaSR v2.1)** dataset [(Gasset et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-4269-2021), formerly known as RDRS2.1:

- Precipitation  
- Specific humidity  
- Air temperature  
- Longwave radiation  
- Shortwave radiation  
- Wind speed  
- Surface pressure  

### Geospatial Datasets

- **MERIT Hydro** – Terrain and river network data 
- **Landsat NALCMS 2022** – Land cover data from the North American Land Change Monitoring System
