# National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) Project â€“ MESH Model Setup

## ðŸ§ª Model Cases

- **Lap0_Base case_0_0**: Run with uncalibrated parameters  
- **Lap0_Base case_0_01**: GRU parameterization  
- **Lap0_Base case_0_02**: Distributed parameterization  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective and Scope

The objective of this project is to generate accurate, regional-scale projections of hydroclimate variables under various climate change scenarios.

This preliminary MESH run offers valuable insights into current hydrological conditions across Canadaâ€™s transboundary basins, focusing on simulating surface water processes, including:

- Streamflow
- Evapotranspiration

This covers:
- Initial setup and execution of the MESH model using historical climate data
- Model setup metadata and output

## ðŸŒŽ Study Domain and Dataset

The study domain encompasses all of Canadaâ€™s river basins, including **Transboundary River Basins (CanTrans)** that span the Canadaâ€“United States border.

Key transboundary systems include:

- Columbia River Basin
- Yukon River Basin
- Mackenzie River Basin
