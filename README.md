Repository for the NAS project model set up along with its metadata

Lap0_Base case_0_0 : Run with uncalibrated paramters
Lap0_Base case_0_01 : GRU parameterization
Lap0_Base case_0_02 : Distributed parameterization

Objective and Scope
The objective of this project is to generate accurate, regional-scale projections of hydroclimate variables under various climate change scenarios. The preliminary MESH run offers provides valuable insights into the current hydrological conditions across Canada’s transboundary basins, focusing on simulating surface water processes, including streamflow and evapotranspiration. This report covers the initial setup and execution of the MESH model using historical climate data, followed by a preliminary analysis of the model’s output. It also examines the implications for streamflow prediction and water management within Canada’s transboundary basins. 

Study domain and dataset 
The study domain covers the whole of encompasses all of Canada’s river basins, including  and its Transboundary River Basin (CanTrans) that extend across national boundaries, particularly those shared between Canada and the United States. This domain focuses on the geographical and hydrological characteristics of these shared river basins. that span across national boundaries, particularly those shared between Canada and United States. Figure 1 shows the Canada’s river basins, highlighting ian and its transboundary river basins, including key transboundary river systems like the Columbia River, Yukon River Basin, and the Mackenzie River Basin.
